    <h1>Auto Scaling and Load Balancing AWS Architecture</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to load balance 
        and automatically scale your AWS infrastructure. 
        <br>
        <br>
        ELB automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple 
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. ELB provides the 
        amount of load balancing capacity needed to route application traffic to 
        help you achieve fault tolerance in your applications. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Auto Scaling help to maintain application availability and give you the 
        ability to scale your Amazon EC2 capacity out or in automatically 
        according to conditions that you define. You can use auto scaling to help 
        ensure that you are running your desired number of EC2 instances. Auto 
        scaling can also automatically increase the number of EC2 instances during 
        spikes in demand to maintain performance and can decrease capacity during 
        lulls to reduce costs. Auto scaling is well suited to applications that 
        have stable demand patterns or that experience hourly, daily, or weekly 
        variability in usage.
    </p>
    <h2>Task 1: Creating an AMI for auto scaling</h2>

    <p>In this task, you create an AMI from the existing Web Server 1. This 
        action saves the contents of the boot disk so that new instances can be 
        launched with identical content. On the AWS Management Console, in the 
        Search bar, enter and choose EC2 to open the Amazon EC2 Management 
        Console. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/Pic1.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">

    <p>In the left navigation pane, locate the Instances section, and choose 
        Instances. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>The Test webserver instance is listed. You now create an AMI based on this 
        instance. Choose the Test webserver instance, which should appear in a 
        Running state. From the Actions dropdown list, choose Image and templates 
        > Create image, 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic3.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>and then configure the following options: For Image name, enter Web Server 
        AMI. For Image description - optional, enter Test AMI for Web Server . 
        Choose Create image 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>The confirmation screen displays the AMI ID for your new AMI. You use this 
        AMI when launching the Auto Scaling group later in the lab. 
    </p>

    <h2>Task 2: Creating a load balancer </h2>

    <p>In this task, you create a load balancer that can balance traffic across 
        multiple EC2 instances and Availability Zones. In the left navigation 
        pane, locate the Load Balancing section, and choose Load Balancers. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Choose create load balancer. In the Load balancer types section, for 
        Application Load Balancer, choose Create. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>On the Create Application Load Balancer page, in the Basic configuration 
        section, configure the following option: For the Load balancer name, enter 
        LabELB.  Scheme default setting i.e. internet facing, IP address type: 
        IPV4.

    <p>In the Network mapping section, configure the following options: For VPC, 
        choose Lab VPC. For Mappings, choose both Availability Zones listed. For 
        the first Availability Zone, choose Public Subnet 1. For the second 
        Availability Zone, choose Public Subnet 2. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>These options configure the load balancer to operate across multiple 
        Availability Zones. In the Security groups section, choose the X for the 
        default security group to remove it. From the Security groups dropdown 
        list, choose Web Security Group. The Web Security Group has already been 
        created for you, which permits HTTP access. In the Listeners and routing 
        section, choose the Create target group link.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Note: This link opens a new browser tab with the Create target group 
        configuration options. On the new Target groups browser tab, in the Basic 
        configuration section, configure the following: For Choose a target type, 
        choose Instances. For Target group name, enter lab-target-group . At the 
        bottom of the page, choose Next. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic11.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>On the Register targets page, choose Create target group. Once the target 
        group has been created successfully, close the Target groups browser tab. 
    </p>

    <p>Return to the Load balancers browser tab. In the Listeners and routing 
        section, choose Refresh to the right of the Forward to dropdown list for 
        Default action. 
        From the Forward to dropdown list, choose lab-target-group. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic13.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>At the bottom of the page, choose Create load balancer. You should receive 
        a message similar to the following: Successfully created load balancer: 
        LabELB . To view the LabELB load balancer that you created, choose View 
        load balancer.

    <h2>Task 3: Creating a launch template </h2>
    <p>In this task, you create a launch template for your Auto Scaling group. A 
        launch template is a template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch 
        EC2 instances. When you create a launch template, you specify information 
        for the instances, such as the AMI, instance type, key pair, security 
        group, and disks.
