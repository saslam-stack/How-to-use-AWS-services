    <h1>How to create users, groups and manage permission through AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In many business environments, access involves a single login to a 
        computer or a network of computer systems that provides the user access to 
        all resources on the network. This access includes rights to personal and 
        shared folders on a network server, company intranets, printers, and other 
        network resources and devices. Unauthorized users can quickly exploit 
        these same resources if the access control and associated authentication 
        procedures are not set up properly. 
    </p>
    <h2> AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) </h2>
    <p>AWS IAM can be used for the following: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manage users and their access.</li>
        <li>Manage roles and their permissions.</li>
        <li>Manage federated users and their permissions.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Manage users and their access:</h3>
    <p> You can create users and assign them 
        individual security credentials (access keys, passwords, and multi-factor 
        authentication devices). You can manage permissions to control which 
        operations a user can perform.
    </p>
    <h3>Manage roles and their permissions:</h3>
    <p>An IAM role is similar to a user 
        in that a role is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine 
        what the identity can and cannot do in Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, 
        instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended 
        to be assumable by anyone who needs it.
    </p>
    <h3>Manage federated users and their permissions: </h3>
    <p>You can activate identity 
        federation to allow existing users in your enterprise to access the AWS 
        Management Console, to call AWS application programming interfaces (APIs), 
        and to access resources without the need to create an IAM user for each 
        identity. 
    </p>
    <h2>Create an account password policy.</h2>
    <p>In this task, you create a custom password policy for your AWS account. 
        This policy affects all the users associated with the account. 
    </p>
    <p>First, note the Region that you are in (for example, London eu-west-2). 
        The upper-right corner of the console page displays your Region. In the 
        AWS Management Console, in the search box, enter IAM and select it.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic1.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose Account settings. Here you can see the 
        default password policy that is currently in effect. The company that you 
        are working for has much stricter requirements, and you need to update 
        this policy. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Choose Change password policy. Under Select your account password 
        policy requirements, configure the following options: For Enforce 
        minimum password length, change 9 to 10 characters. Select every 
        check box except the check box for Password expiration requires 
        administrator reset. For Enable password expiration, leave the 
        default option of 90 days. For Prevent password reuse, leave the 
        default option of 5 passwords. Choose Save changes. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic3.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <h2>Explore users and user groups.</h2>
    <H3>How to create a user:</H3>
    <P>In the left navigation pane of the AWS management console, select Users 
        and click on create user. 
    </P>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Give user a name, click on next to Provide user access to the AWS 
        Management Console – optional (only if access required). Click radio 
        button  Autogenerated password and Users must create a new password at 
        next sign-in – Recommended and click next. In the Permissions options 
        choose one of radio button Add user to group, Copy permissions or Attach 
        policies directly and finally cick on Create user.  I have created 3 
        users. In the left navigation pane, choose Users. The following IAM users 
        have been created for you: user-1, user-2, user-3
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Choose user-1. his option bring you to a Summary page for user-1. The 
        Permissions tab is displayed. Notice that user-1 does not have any 
        permissions.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Choose the Groups tab. user-1 is also is not a member of any user groups. 
        A user group consists of several users who need access to the same data. 
        Privileges can be distributed to the entire group of users rather than to 
        each individual. This option is much more efficient when applying 
        permissions and provides greater overall control of access to resources 
        than applying permissions to individuals. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Choose the Security credentials tab. user-1 is assigned a Console 
        password. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">

    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose User groups.The following user groups 
        have already been created for you: EC2-Admin, EC2-Support, S3-Support 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose the EC2-Support group. This option brings you to the Summary page 
        for the EC2-Support group. Choose the Permissions tab. This group has a 
        managed policy associated with it called AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess. Managed 
        policies are pre-built policies (built either by AWS or by your 
        administrators) that can be attached to IAM users and user groups. When 
        the policy is updated, the changes to the policy are immediately applied 
        to all users and user groups that are attached to the policy. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Next to the AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess policy, select the plus sign to show 
        the policy. A policy defines what actions are allowed or denied for 
        specific AWS resources. This policy grants permission to list and describe 
        information about Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Load 
        Balancing (ELB), Amazon CloudWatch, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling. This 
        ability to view resources but not modify them is ideal for assigning to a 
        support role. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic11.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>The following is the basic structure of the statements in an IAM 
        policy: Effect indicates whether to Allow or Deny the permissions. 
        Action specifies the API calls that can be made against an AWS 
        service (for example, cloudwatch:ListMetrics). Resource defines the 
        scope of entities covered by the policy rule (for example, a 
        specific Amazon Simple Storage Service [Amazon S3] bucket, EC2 
        instance, or * which means any resource). 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic12.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <h2>How to add user to user groups.</h2>
    <h3>Add user-1 to the S3-Support group</h3>
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose User groups. Choose the S3-Support 
        group. Choose the Users tab. In the Users tab, choose Add users. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic13.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>In the Add users to S3-Support window, configure the following options: 
        Select the check box for user-1. Choose Add Users. In the Users tab, you 
        see that user-1 has been added to the group.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic14.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>You can Add user-2 to the EC2-Support group and Add user-3 to the EC2
        Admin group. Each group should have a 1 in the Users column for the number 
        of users in each group.
    </p>
    <h2>Sign in and test user permissions.</h2>
    <p>You test the permissions of each IAM user. In the left navigation pane of 
        IAM, choose Dashboard. The AWS Account section includes a Sign-in URL for 
        IAM users in this account. This link should look similar to the following: <a href=" 
        https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank">AWS management console sign in</a>. You can use this link 
        to sign in to the AWS account that you are currently using. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic15.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Copy the Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account to a text editor. Open 
        a private window (Search google how to open private window). Paste the 
        Sign-in URL for IAM users in this account into your private window, and 
        press Enter. 
    </p>
    <p>You now sign in as user-1, who has been hired as your Amazon S3 storage 
        support staff. Sign in using the following credentials: IAM user name: 
        Enter user-1, Password: Enter Lab-Password1 . Choose Sign in. If you see a 
        dialog prompting you to switch to the new console home, choose Switch to 
        the new Console Home. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic16.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>From the Services menu, choose S3. Choose the name of one of your buckets, 
        and browse the contents. Because your user is part of the S3-Support group 
        in IAM, they have permission to view a list of S3 buckets and their 
        contents. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic17.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>Now, test whether they have access to Amazon EC2.From the Services menu, 
        choose EC2. In the left navigation pane, choose Instances. You cannot see 
        any instances. Instead, you see a message that says, You are not 
        authorized to perform this operation. This message appears because your 
        user has not been assigned any permissions to use Amazon EC2.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic18.png" alt="AWS Management Console Screenshot">
    <p>You can now sign in as user-2, and user 3 to check your access in the 
        same way you did with user 1. User-2 and user 3 have different access. 
    </p>
