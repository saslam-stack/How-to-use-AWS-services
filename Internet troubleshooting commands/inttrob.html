    <h1>Internet Protocol Troubleshooting Commands</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You need to SSH into AWS Linux EC2 instance (You can read this article <a href="https://mypublicbucketforyou.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/Linux/How+to+SSH+AWS+Linux+EC2+instance.pdf">How to SSH into AWS EC2 instance</a> to SSH into AWS Linux EC2 instance.)
    </p>
    <p>Some layers have commands related to them to help with troubleshooting. 
        The following is an example of how the troubleshooting commands flow with 
        the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model:
    </p>
    
    <h2>Layer 3 (network): The ping and traceroute commands </h2>
    
     <h3>Ping command </h3>
     
    <p>If you have launched an EC2 instance. To test connectivity to and from it, 
        run the ping command. You can use this command to test connectivity and 
        ensure that it allows Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) requests on 
        the security level, such as security groups and network ACLs. In the Linux 
        terminal, run this command, and press Enter: ping 8.8.8.8 -c 3. This is 
        the ping command. When you run this command, you can input an IP or URL 
        followed by options. In this example, the -c stands for count, and 3 
        stands for how many requests you are requesting. The most common reason is 
        to test connectivity to something such as a server. The ping command sends 
        ICMP echo requests from your machine to the server that you are trying to 
        reach (for example, amazon.com). The server sends an echo reply with a 
        round-trip time. You use the ping command mostly to troubleshoot 
        connectivity issues and reachability to a specific target. You can also 
        use it to bring a specific network up if traffic needs to continuously 
        flow through a network. You can also send a continuous ping. 
    </p>

    <h3>Traceroute command </h3>
    <p>If you are having latency issues, like connection is taking a long time, 
        and having packet loss. If you aren't sure if it is related to AWS or your 
        internet service provider (ISP). To investigate, you can run the 
        traceroute command from your AWS resource to the server that they are 
        trying to reach. If the loss happens toward the server, the issue is most 
        likely the ISP. If the loss is toward AWS, you might need to investigate 
        other factors that might limiting networking connectivity. 
    </p>
    <p>In the Linux terminal, run this command traceroute 8.8.8.8 and press 
        Enter. Packet loss, seen as percentages, can occur at each hop, and this 
        loss usually occurs because of an issue with the user's local area network 
        (LAN) or ISP.
    </p>
    <img src="./images/pic2.png" alt="Screenshoot">
    <p>You can pinpoint an issue or error when the hostnames and IP addresses on 
        either side of a jump have failed. Three asterisks (***) indicate a failed 
        hop.
    </p>
    <p>The traceroute command reports on the path and latency that the packet 
        takes to get from your machine to the destination (8.8.8.8). Each server 
        is called a hop. There can be packet loss, seen as percentages, at each 
        loss, which is usually due to the user's local area network (LAN) or ISP; 
        however, if the packet loss occurs toward the end of the route, then the 
        issue is more than likely the server connection. You can pinpoint an issue 
        or error when hostnames and IP addresses on either side of a failed jump, 
        which looks like three asterisks (***). 
    </p>
    <h2>Layer 4 (transport): The netstat and telnet commands </h2>
    <p>To check if one of the ports on a certain subnet is compromised, you run 
        the netstat command on a local host on that subnet to confirm if the port 
        is listening when it shouldn't be. In the Linux terminal, run the this 
        command, and press Enter:  netstat –tp 
    </p>
    <img src="./images/pic3.png" alt="">
    <p>The netstat command shows the current established TCP connections from 
        which the host is listening. When troubleshooting networking issues 
        starting with the host machine and working outward, you can run this 
        command to understand which ports are listening and which are not. Because 
        this command gives you a snapshot of your layer 4 connectivity, using this 
        command will help you save time when trying to narrow down a large 
        networking issue.
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>netstat –tp : Confirms established connections.</li>
            <li>netstat –ntlp : Outputs listening services but does not resolve port 
                numbers.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <img src="./images/pic4.png" alt="Screenshoot">
    <h2>Layer 7 (application): The curl command </h2>
    <p>If you have an Apache server running, and you want to test if you are 
        getting a successful request (200 OK), which indicates that your website 
        is running successfully. You run a curl request to see if your Apache 
        server returns a 200 OK 
    </p>
    <p>In Linux terminal enter curl -vLo /dev/null https://aws.com </p>
    <p>-I: This option provides header information and specifies that the request 
        method is Head. <br>  -i: This option specifies that the request method is GET. <br>  -k: This option tells the command to ignore SSL errors. <br>  -v: This option is verbose. It shows what the computer is doing or what 
        the software is loading during startup. <br>  -o /dev/null: This option will send HTML and CSS in response to null.
    </p>
    <p>You can use the curl command to transfer data between you and the server. 
        The curl command can use many different protocols, but the most common are 
        HTTP and HTTPS. You can use the curl command to troubleshoot communication 
        from your local device to a server.
