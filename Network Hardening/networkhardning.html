    <h1><i>how to harden network using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager</i></h1>
    <hr>

    <p>After launching infrastructure on AWS network finding vulnerabilities can 
        be a challenge for any company. Amazon Inspector is an automated 
        vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for 
        software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Amazon Inspector 
        runs scans that analyse all your network configurations—such as security 
        groups, network access control lists (network ACLs), route tables, and 
        internet gateways—together to infer reachability. You don't need to send 
        packets across the virtual private cloud (VPC) network or connect to 
        Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance network ports. It’s 
        like packetless network mapping and reconnaissance. <br> 
        <br>
        From Amazon Inspector, you will use the network reachability package to 
        analyse your network configurations to find security vulnerabilities in 
        your EC2 instances. The findings that Amazon Inspector generates also 
        provide guidance about restricting access that is not secure. 
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Launch EC2 instance and add a tag.</h2>
    <p>To create an assessment target for Amazon Inspector Classic to assess, you 
        start by tagging the EC2 instances that you want to include in your 
        target. In this task, you tag the BastionServer instance. <br> 
        <br>
        Every AWS tag consists of a key and value pair of your choice. For 
        example, you might choose to name your key Name and your value 
        MyFirstInstance. <br>
        <br>
        In the AWS Management Console, choose Services and select EC2. If you see 
        New EC2 Experience at the upper-left of your screen, confirm that EC2 
        instance (e.g. Test Server) is selected.  In the left navigation pane, 
        choose Instances. The running Test Server and Application Server EC2 
        instances are listed. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic1.png" alt="AWS management Console screenshot">
    <p>Choose the Test Server instance. Choose the Tags tab and Choose Manage 
        tags.
        <br> 
        Choose Add tag, and then enter the following information: Key: 
        SecurityScan Value: true. Choose Save.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="AWS management Console screenshot">

    <h2>Step 2: Configure and run Amazon Inspector.</h2>
    <p>In this task, you learn how to run an agentless network audit on 
        your EC2 instances using Amazon Inspector. For this lab, you use the 
        network reachability rules package.
        <br> 
        In the AWS Management Console, choose then Services menu. Then 
        choose Security, Identity, & Compliance and choose Inspector. To 
        open the navigation pane, choose on the left. Choose Switch to 
        Inspector Classic
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic3.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose Get started or click on help me create an assessment.

    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose Advanced setup at the bottom right side of the screen.</p>
    <img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="">
    <p>In the Define an assessment target section, configure the following 
        options: For Name, enter Network vulnerability Audit, Clear the check box 
        for All Instances. For Tags: Key, choose SecurityScan. For Tags: Value, 
        choose true. Clear the check box for Install Agents. Choose Next.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="">
    <p>In the Define an assessment template section, configure the following 
        options: For Name, enter Assessment-Template-Network. For Rules packages, 
        leave Network Reachability-1.1 selected, but choose the next to each of 
        the other packages to remove them. For Duration, choose 15 Minutes. Clear 
        the check box for Assessment Schedule. Choose Next. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose Create.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="">
    <p>You should see a SUCCESS notification, which confirms that the assessment 
        run was initiated. It takes about 3-5 minutes to complete. While you wait, 
        learn more about Amazon Inspector. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="">

    <h2>Check the status of the scan:</h2>
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment runs. In the Amazon 
        Inspector - Assessment Runs section, choose the in the row for the run 
        that you initiated to expand it and access more options for your run. To 
        see the status of the run, choose Show status. If you do not see Show 
        status, choose at the top. To close and return to the previous screen, 
        choose Close. Once the status changes to Analysis complete, 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose Findings in the left navigation pane.        
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Analyse Amazon Inspector findings</h2>
    <p>The findings that these rules generate show whether your ports are 
        reachable from the internet through an internet gateway (including 
        instances behind Application Load Balancers or Classic Load Balancers), a 
        VPC peering connection, or a virtual private network (VPN) through a 
        virtual gateway. These findings also highlight network configurations that 
        allow for potentially malicious access, such as mismanaged security 
        groups, ACLs, and internet gateways. 
    </p>
    <P>Choose to expand the high-severity finding. You should see the following 
        key details: AWS agent ID shows you the affected EC2 instance. Description 
        shows the reason for the finding. In this case, TCP port 23, which is 
        associated with Telnet, is reachable from the internet. Recommendation 
        provides remediation suggestions.
    </P>
    <P>Telnet is a text-based terminal emulation utility that is part of the 
        TCP/IP suite of protocols. It allows a system to connect to a remote host 
        to perform commands as if you were on the console of the remote machine. 
    </P>
    <img src="./Images/pic11.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose to expand the medium-severity findings and analyse the details. For 
        the medium-severity finding, TCP port 22, which is associated with SSH, is 
        reachable from the internet. SSH, like the Telnet utility, gives a user 
        the ability to log in to a remote machine and perform commands as if they 
        were on the console of that system. Telnet, however, is insecure because 
        its data isn't encrypted when communicated. SSH provides a secure, 
        encrypted tunnel to access another system remotely. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic12.png" alt="">

    <h2>Step 4: Update security groups.</h2>
    <p>You see a few remediation options for the security findings that Amazon 
        Inspector discovered. The first option shows how to lock down port 22 to 
        specific IP addresses. 
    </p>
    <P>Choose to expand the details of the high-severity finding. In the 
        Recommendation section, choose the link to the security group. The link 
        should look similar to the following example:  sg-074c54d73db364b82.
    </P>
    <img src="./Images/pic13.png" alt="">
    <p>When the link opens, you can see the Test Server security group that is 
        attached to the EC2 instance that has produced findings within Amazon 
        Inspector. 
    </p>
    <p>Choose the Inbound rules tab. These are the current inbound rules for this 
        security group. They are also the high and medium findings that Amazon 
        Inspector caught.
    </p>
    <p>Choose Edit inbound rules. For the inbound rule associated with port range 
        23, choose Delete. Port 23 Telnet is vulnerable to security attacks, and 
        the SSH protocol helps you to overcome many security issues of Telnet. SSH 
        is now the only major protocol to access the network devices and servers 
        over the internet. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic14.png" alt="">
    <p>For the SSH rule, remove the current inbound IP address of 0.0.0.0/0 by 
        choosing the X next to it to update the resource. The 0.0.0.0/0 IP address 
        for inbound rules means that port 22 is accessible from anyone on the 
        internet. You can adjust the inbound rules so that only your IP address is 
        able to access port 22. Although this option is much more secure, it still 
        has vulnerabilities. For example, someone could access the computer that 
        is associated with that IP address and gain access. For Source, choose the 
        Custom dropdown list, and then select My IP. Choose Save rules. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic15.png" alt="">
    <p>Step 4: Re-scan the AWS environment.        
    </p>
    <p>Navigate to the browser tab that has Amazon Inspector open. In the left 
        navigation pane, choose Assessment templates. Select the check box next to 
        Assessment-Template-Network, and choose Run.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic16.png" alt="">
    <p>This step runs the same scan from earlier in the lab and produces findings 
        from the security group updates. The scan takes approximately 30-60 
        seconds to complete. 
    </p>
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose Assessment runs, and refresh every 10
        15 seconds until the Status changes to Analysis complete. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic17.png" alt="">
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose Findings, and then choose Date to sort 
        by most-recent findings. The high-severity finding is now gone, but the 
        medium-severity finding remains. Although port 22 was scoped down to allow 
        access to only your IP address, port 22 is still technically open to the 
        internet outside the VPC. 
    </p>
    <h2>Step 5: Replace Bastion Server (Test Server) with Systems Manager.</h2>
    <p>You can replace the Bastion Server (Test Server) instance, which has 
        primarily used SSH to connect to the Application Server within the private 
        subnet. Instead, you use Session Manager via Systems Manager. 
    </p>
    <p>Systems Manager is a secure end-to-end management solution for hybrid 
        cloud environments. Systems Manager is the operations hub for your AWS 
        applications and resources and consists of four core feature groups. 
    </p>
    <p>In the AWS Management Console, choose Services and select EC2. In the left 
        navigation pane, choose Security Groups. Choose the Security group ID for 
        Test Server SG. Choose Edit inbound rules. Choose Delete, and then choose 
        Save rules to remove the SSH inbound rule. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic18.png" alt="">
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose Instances. Select the check box for 
        Test Server. Then choose the Instance state dropdown list, and choose Stop 
        instance. In the confirmation dialog, choose Stop.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic19.png" alt="">
    <p>Next, connect to the Application Server directly using Session Manager. 
        With Session Manager, you can quickly and securely access your EC2 
        instances through an interactive one-click browser-based shell or through 
        the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) without the need to open inbound 
        ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys. Select the check box 
        next to Application Server, and then choose Connect. You are now connected 
        directly to the Application Server. Enter in the following Linux commands 
        to change the directory and to view the current working directory of the 
        Application Server.  Cd ~  and then pwd
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic20.png" alt="">
    <p>Finally scan to verify there are zero findings. Scan again by choosing 
        Assessment runs,  
    </p>
