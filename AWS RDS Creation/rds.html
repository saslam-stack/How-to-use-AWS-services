    <H1>Creating an Amazon RDS instance by using the AWS CLI </H1>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <p>You can create an Amazon RDS instance by using the AWS CLI. To begin with, 
       I have already created two EC2 instance (AWS CLI host and KKC instance) 
       and VPC (KKC VPC). Read <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/create-vpc.html" target="_blank">this article</a> if need help in building a AWS VPC.
    </p>
    <p>CLI Host EC2 instance has the AWS CLI installed on it as part of 
        provisioning. You can run AWS CLI commands to do the following: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Configure the AWS CLI.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Create the following prerequisite components required to build the Amazon RDS (relational database service) instance.
        <ol>
            
        <li>A security group firewall for the Amazon RDS instance. </li>
        <li>Two private subnets and a database subnet group. </li>
        <li>Create the Amazon RDS Maria DB instance. </li>
        </ol>

    </p> 
    
    <h2>Connecting to the CLI Host instance: </h2>
    <p>On the AWS Management Console, in the Search bar, enter and choose EC2 to 
        open the EC2 Management Console. In the navigation pane, choose instances. 
        From the list of instances, select the CLI Host EC2 instance. Choose 
        Connect.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic1.png" alt="AWS Management Console screenshot">
    <p>On the EC2 Instance Connect tab, choose Connect. 

    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="AWS Management Console screenshot">
    <p>SSH: If you prefer to use an SSH client to connect to the EC2 instance, 
        read this article to <a href="https://saslam-stack.github.io/AWS-Linux-system-administration-/How%20to%20SSH%20AWS%20EC2/SSH%20EC2.html" target="_blank">Connect to Your AWS EC2 Instance</a>. Now that you are 
        connected to the CLI Host instance, you can configure and use the AWS CLI 
        to call AWS services. 
    </p>
    <H2>Configuring the AWS CLI: </H2>
    <p>In this task, you configure the AWS CLI by providing the 
        configuration parameters that were made available to you when the 
        lab was provisioned. After configuration, you run AWS CLI commands 
        to interact with AWS services. To set up the AWS CLI profile with 
        credentials, in the EC2 Instance Connect terminal, run the following 
        command: 
        <br>
        aws configure 
    </p>
    <p>When prompted, enter the following information: 

    </p>
    <p>AWS Access Key ID: Enter the value for AccessKey. (You can use IAM to 
        create AccessKey and secreteKey ). <br>
        AWS Secret Access Key: Enter the value for SecretKey. <br>
        Default region name: Enter your AWS region e.g. us-west-2. <br>
        Default output format: Enter json. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic3.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>Now you are ready to run AWS CLI commands to interact with AWS services. 

    </p>
    <h2>Creating prerequisite components: </h2>
    <p>You need create the prerequisite infrastructure components for the Amazon 
        RDS instance. Specifically, you create the following components: 
        <br>
        <br>
        KKCDatabaseSG (Security group for the Amazon RDS database) 
        KKCDB Private Subnet 1 
        KKCDB Private Subnet 2 
        KKCDB Subnet Group (Database subnet group) 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now, you run AWS CLI commands in the EC2 Instance Connect terminal. 
        First, you create the KKCDatabaseSG security group. This security group is 
        used to protect the Amazon RDS instance. It will have an inbound rule that 
        allows only MySQL requests (using the default TCP protocol and port 3306) 
        from instances that are associated with the KKCSecurityGroup. This rule 
        ensures that only the KKCInstance is able to access the database. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        To create the security group, run the following command. In the command, 
        replace <KKCInstance VPC ID> with the KKCVpcID which was created as before 
        building RDS database instance : 
    </p>
    <p>ws ec2 create-security-group \
        <br>
         --group-name KKCDatabaseSG \ 
         <br>
         --description "Security group for KKC database" \
         <br>
          --vpc-id <KKCInstance VPC ID> 
            <br>
            <br>
        Final command should look like below: 
        <br>
        <br> 
        aws ec2 create-security-group \ 
        <br>
        --group-name KKCDatabaseSG \ 
        <br>
        --description "Security group for KKC database" \ 
        <br>
        --vpc-id vpc-0d5f3e369fc1845f6 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>"GroupId": sg-0e6615ed661a7146e 

    </p>
    <p>Next, you create the inbound rule for the security group. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To create the inbound rule, run the following command. In the command, 
        replace <KKCDatabaseSG Group ID> with the GroupId value that you recorded 
        in the previous step, and replace <KKCSecurityGroup Group ID> with the 
        KKCSecurityGroupID value that can be found in the details section of the 
        KKC EC2 instance: 
    </p>
    <p>ws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \ 
        <br>
         --group-id <KKCDatabaseSG Group ID> \ 
        <br> 
        --protocol tcp --port 3306 \
        <br>
         --source-group <KKCSecurityGroup Group ID> 

    </p>
    <p>Final command should look like below: 

    </p>
    <p>ws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
        <br>
     --group-id sg-0e6615ed661a7146e \ 
     <br>
     --protocol tcp --port 3306 \ 
     <br>
     --source-group sg-06e2dcd4c1ee32a36 

    </p>
    <p>To confirm that the inbound rule was applied appropriately, run the 
        following command:
    </p>
    <p>ws ec2 describe-security-groups \
        <br>
     --query "SecurityGroups[*].[GroupName,GroupId,IpPermissions]" \ 
     <br>
     --filters "Name=group-name,Values='KKCDatabaseSG'" 

    </p>
    <p>The output of the command should show that the KKCDatabaseSG security 
        group now has an inbound rule that allows connections from TCP port 3306 
        if the source of the connection is an instance that has the 
        KKCSecurityGroup Group ID association. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>Next, you create two private subnets and a database subnet group. First, 
        you create KKCDB Private Subnet 1. This subnet hosts the RDS DB instance. 
        It is a private subnet that is defined in the same Availability Zone as 
        the KKCInstance.
        <br>
        <br> 
        You must assign the subnet a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) address 
        block that is within the address range of the VPC but that does not 
        overlap with the address range of any other subnet in the VPC. This reason 
        is why you collected the information about the VPC and existing subnet 
        CIDR blocks: 
        <br>
        KKC VPC IPv4 CIDR block: 10.200.0.0/20 
        KKC Public Subnet 1 IPv4 CIDR block: 10.200.0.0/24
        <br>
        <br> 
        Consider these address ranges. Can you find a suitable CIDR block for the 
        private subnet? One possible answer is to use the address range 
        10.200.2.0/23. 
        <br>
        <br>
        To create the subnet, run the following command. In the command, replace 
        <KKCInstance VPC ID> and <KKCInstance Availability Zone> with the values 
        of KKCVpcID and KKCInstanceAZ, respectively, that can be found on AWS 
        management console or using AWS CLI commands. 
    </p>
    <p>aws ec2 create-subnet \
        <br>
    --vpc-id <KKCInstance VPC ID> \ 
        <br>
    --cidr-block 10.200.2.0/23 \
    <br> 
    --availability-zone <KKCInstance Availability Zone> 
        <br>
        <br>
        Final command should look like below: 
        <br>
        <br>
        aws ec2 create-subnet \ 
        <br>
        --vpc-id vpc-0d5f3e369fc1845f6 \
        <br> 
        --cidr-block 10.200.2.0/23 \
        <br> 
        --availability-zone us-west-2a 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>From the output of the command, note the value for SubnetId. You use this 
        information later for KKCDB Private Subnet 1. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "SubnetId": subnet-08a3a0bf83f9a710e 
    </p>
    <p>Next, you create KKCDB Private Subnet 2. This is the extra subnet that is 
        required to form the database subnet group. It is an empty private subnet 
        that is defined in a different Availability Zone than the KKCInstance. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Similar to what you did in the previous steps, you must assign a CIDR 
        address block to the subnet that is within the address range of the VPC 
        but does not overlap with the address range of any other subnet in the 
        VPC. So far, you have used the following address ranges: 
        <br>
        <br>
        KKC VPC IPv4 CIDR block: 10.200.0.0/20 
        KKC Public Subnet 1 IPv4 CIDR block: 10.200.0.0/24 
        KKC Private Subnet 1 IPv4 CIDR block: 10.200.2.0/23
        <br>
        <br> 
        You use the 10.200.10.0/23 address range for this second private subnet. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For the Availability Zone for the second subnet, you can choose any other 
        Availability Zone (but not the one ending in a).
        <br>
        <br> 
        To create the second subnet, run the following command. In the command, 
        replace <KKCInstance VPC ID> with the value of KKCVpcID that you recorded 
        earlier, and replace <availability-zone> with an Availability Zone that is 
        different than the one that you used for the first subnet (for example, 
        us-west-2b).
    </p>
    <p>ws ec2 create-subnet \
        <br>
         --vpc-id <KKCInstance VPC ID> \
            <br>
         --cidr-block 10.200.10.0/23 \ 
         <br>
         --availability-zone <availability-zone> 
            <br>
            <br>
        Final command should look like below: 
        <br>
        <br>
        aws ec2 create-subnet \ 
        <br>
        --vpc-id vpc-0d5f3e369fc1845f6 \
        <br> 
        --cidr-block 10.200.10.0/23 \ 
        <br>
        --availability-zone us-west-2b 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>From the output of the command, note the value for SubnetId. You use this 
        information later for KKCDB Private Subnet 2. 
        <br>
        <br>
        "SubnetId": subnet-0b8b9d812debcd063 
    </p>
    <p>Next, you create KKCDB Subnet Group. For the Amazon RDS instance for the 
        café, the DB subnet group consists of the two private subnets that you 
        created in the previous steps: KKCDB Private Subnet 1 and KKCDB Private 
        Subnet 2.In the terminal window, run the following command. In the 
        command, replace <KKC Private Subnet 1 ID> and <KKC Private Subnet 2 ID> 
        with the subnet ID values that you recorded earlier for each private 
        subnet. Note that there is a space between the subnet IDs in the command. 
    </p>
    <p>ws rds create-db-subnet-group \ 
        <br>
        --db-subnet-group-name "KKCDB Subnet Group" \ 
        <br>
        --db-subnet-group-description "DB subnet group for KKC" \ 
        <br>
        --subnet-ids <KKC Private Subnet 1 ID> <KKC Private Subnet 2 ID> \
            <br> 
        --tags "Key=Name,Value= KKCDatabaseSubnetGroup" 
        <br>
        <br>
        Final command should look like below:
        <br>
        <br>  
        aws rds create-db-subnet-group \
        <br> 
        --db-subnet-group-name "KKCDB Subnet Group" \ 
        <br>
        --db-subnet-group-description "DB subnet group for KKC" \
        <br> 
        --subnet-ids subnet-08a3a0bf83f9a710e subnet-0b8b9d812debcd063 \ 
        <br>
        --tags "Key=Name,Value= KKCDatabaseSubnetGroup" 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">

    <h2>Creating the Amazon RDS MariaDB instance: </h2>
    <p>You now create the KKCDBInstance that is shown in the final architecture. 
        Using the AWS CLI, you create an Amazon RDS MariaDB instance with the 
        following configuration settings:
        <br> 
        DB instance identifier: KKCDBInstance 
        Engine option: mariadb 
        DB engine version: 80.0.35 
        DB instance class: db.t3.micro 
        Allocated storage: 20 GB 
        Availability Zone: KKCInstanceAZ 
        DB Subnet group: KKCDB Subnet Group 
        VPC security groups: KKCDatabaseSG   
        Public accessibility: No 
        Username: admin 
        Password: Kkcmigration!8 
        <br>
        <br>
        These options specify the creation of a Mysql database instance that is 
        deployed in the same Availability Zone as the KKC instance. The Msql 
        database instance also uses the DB subnet group that you built in the 
        previous step. In the terminal window, run the following command. In the 
        command, replace <KKCInstance Availability Zone> with the KKCInstanceAZ 
        value that you recorded at the beginning, and replace <KKCDatabaseSG Group 
        ID> with the value that you recorded in a previous step. 
        <br>
        <br>
        ws rds create-db-instance \ 
        <br>
        --db-instance-identifier KKCDBInstance \ 
        <br>
        --engine mariadb \ 
        <br>
        --engine-version 10.11.6 \ 
        <br>
        --db-instance-class db.t3.micro \ 
        <br>
        --allocated-storage 20 \ 
        <br>
        --availability-zone us-west-2a \ 
        <br>
        --db-subnet-group-name "KKCDB Subnet Group" \ 
        <br>
        --vpc-security-group-ids sg-0e6615ed661a7146e \ 
        <br>
        --no-publicly-accessible \ 
        <br>
        --master-username admin --master-user-password 'Kkcmigration!8' 
    </p>
    <p>The command immediately returns some information about the database.

    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">

    <p>But the database instance might take up to 10 minutes to become available. 
        Next, you monitor the status of the database instance until it shows a 
        status of available. To check the status of the database, run the 
        following command: 
        <br>
        <br>
        aws rds describe-db-instances \ 
        <br>
        --db-instance-identifier KKCDBInstance \ 
        <br> 
        --query "DBInstances[*].[Endpoint.Address,AvailabilityZone,PreferredBackupWindow,BackupRetentionPe
         riod,DBInstanceStatus]" 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="AWS EC2 connect screenshot">
    <p>Wait a few moments, and repeat the command again. The status progressively 
        changes to backing-up and finally to available. Keep repeating the command 
        until the status shows available. Then record the value that is returned 
        for the endpoint address by using the following format: 
        <br>
        <br>
        RDS Instance Database Endpoint Address: kkcdbinstance.c7g4ymqkse7s.us
        west-2.rds.amazonaws.com 
        <br>
        <br>
        Maria DB created and available can be confirmed on the AWS Management 
        console.
