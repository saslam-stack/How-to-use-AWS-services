    <h1>Monitor an AWS EC2 Instance</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Logging and monitoring are techniques implemented to achieve a common 
        goal. They work together to help ensure that a system's performance 
        baselines and security guidelines are always met.  
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Logging</b> refers to recording and storing data events as log files. Logs 
        contain low-level details that can give you visibility into how your 
        application or system performs under certain circumstances. From a 
        security standpoint, logging helps security administrators identify red 
        flags that are easily overlooked in their system. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Monitoring</b> is the process of analyzing and collecting data to help ensure 
        optimal performance. Monitoring helps detect unauthorized access and helps 
        align your services' usage with organizational security. 
        <br>
        <br>
        You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that initiates when the Amazon 
        Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance exceeds a specific central 
        processing unit (CPU) utilization threshold. You create a subscription 
        using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) that sends an email 
        to you if this alarm is goes off. You log in to the EC2 instance and run a 
        stress test command that causes the CPU utilization of the EC2 instance to 
        reach 100 percent. This test simulates a malicious actor gaining control 
        of the EC2 instance and spiking the CPU. CPU spiking has various possible 
        causes, one of which is malware. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I have already created a preconfigured EC2 instance named <b>Stress Test</b> with 
        an attached AWS IAM role that I will use to connect via AWS Systems 
        Manager session manager.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 1: Configure Amazon SNS </h2>
    <p>You can create an SNS topic and then subscribe to it with an email 
        address. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Amazon SNS is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to
        application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In the AWS Management Console, enter <b>SNS</b> in the search bar, and then 
        choose <strong>Simple Notification Service.</strong> 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/Pic1.png" alt="AWS Management Console">
    <p>On the left, choose the button, choose <strong>Topics</strong>, and then choose 
        <strong>Create topic</strong>. On the <strong>Create topic </strong> page in the Details section, 
        configure the following options: 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="">
    <p><b>Type:</b> Choose <b>Standard</b>. In Name: Enter MyCwAlarm, Choose <b>Create topic</b>. On 
        the <b>MyCwAlarm</b> details page, choose the <b>Subscriptions</b> tab, and then choose 
       <b>Create subscription</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>On the <b>Create subscription</b> page in the <b>Details</b> section, configure 
        the following options: <b>Topic ARN:</b> Leave the default option selected. 
        <b>Protocol:</b> From the dropdown list, choose <b>Email. Endpoint:</b>Enter a 
        valid email address that you can access. Choose <b>Create subscription.</b> 
        In the <b>Details</b> section, the Status should be Pending confirmation.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="">
    <p>You should have received an <b>AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation</b>
        email message at the email address that you provided in the previous step. 
        Open the email that you received with the Amazon SNS subscription 
        notification, and choose <b>Confirm subscription.</b> 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="">
    <p>Go back to the <b>AWS Management Console</b>. In the left navigation pane, choose 
        <b>Subscriptions</b>. The <b>Status</b> should now be <b>Confirmed</b>. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic6.png" alt="">
    <h2>Step 2: Create a CloudWatch alarm </h2>
    <p>In the AWS Management Console, enter <b>Cloudwatch</b> in the search bar, and 
        then choose it. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="">
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose the <b>Metrics</b> dropdown list, and then 
        choose <b>All metrics</b>. CloudWatch usually takes 5-10 minutes after the 
        creation of an EC2 instance to start fetching metric details. On the 
        <b>Metrics</b> page, choose <b>EC2</b>, and choose <b>Per-Instance Metrics</b>. From this page, 
        you can view all the metrics being logged and the specific EC2 instance 
        for the metrics. Select the check box with <b>CPUUtilization</b> as the <b>Metric 
        name</b> for the <b>Stress Test</b> EC2 instance. The following image shows the 
        metrics and instance that you should select. This option displays the 
        graph for the CPU utilization metric, which should be approximately 0 
        because nothing has been done yet.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="">
    <p>In the left navigation pane, choose the <b>Alarms</b>dropdown list, and then 
        choose <b>All alarms</b>. You now create a metric alarm. A metric alarm watches a 
        single CloudWatch metric or the result of a math expression based on 
        CloudWatch metrics. The alarm performs one or more actions based on the 
        value of the metric or expression relative to a threshold over a number of 
        time periods. The action then sends a notification to the SNS topic that 
        you created earlier. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Create alarm</b>. Choose <b>Select metric</b>, choose <b>EC2</b>, and then choose 
        <b>Per-Instance Metrics</b>. Select the check box with <b>CPUUtilization</b> as the 
        <b>Metric name</b> for the <b>Stress Test</b> instance name.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Select metric</b>. On the <b>Specify metric and conditions</b> page, configure 
        the following options: 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Metric: Metric name:</b> Enter CPUUtilization, <b>InstanceId:</b> Leave the default 
        option selected. <b>Statistic:</b> Enter Average , <b>Period:</b> From the dropdown 
        list, choose <b>1 minute.</b> 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic11.png" alt="">
    <p><b>Conditions: Threshold type:</b>  Choose <b>Static</b>. <b>Whenever CPUUtilization</b> is...: 
        Choose <b>Greater > threshold. than... Define the threshold value:</b> Enter 60
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic12.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Next</b>. On the <b>Configure actions</b> page, configure the following options: 
        <b>Notification: Alarm state trigger:</b> Choose <b>In alarm</b>. Select an <b>SNS topic:</b> 
        Choose <b>Select an existing SNS topic</b>. Send a <b>notification to</b>...: Choose the 
        text box, and then choose <b>MyCwAlarm</b>. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic13.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Next</b>, and then configure the following options: 
        <b>Name and description: Alarm name:</b> Enter CPUUtilizationAlarm . <b>Alarm 
        description - optional:</b> Enter CloudWatch alarm for Stress Test EC2 
        instance CPUUtilization . Choose <b>Next</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic14.png" alt="">
    <p>Review the <b>Preview and create page</b>, and then choose <b>Create alarm.</b>
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic15.png" alt="">
    <h2>Step 3: Test the Cloudwatch alarm </h2>
    <p>You can log in to the <b>Stress Test</b> EC2 instance and run a command that 
        stresses the CPU load to 100 percent. This increase in CPU utilization 
        activates the CloudWatch alarm, which causes Amazon SNS to send an email 
        notification to the email address associated with the SNS topic. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Navigate to the AWS console EC2 Dashboard, choose running instance and 
        click on connect.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic16.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose to connect session manager (See AWS documentation for the session 
        manager agent installation instructions). 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic17.png" alt="">
    <p>To manually increase the CPU load of the EC2 instance, run the following 
        command: sudo stress --cpu 10 -v --timeout 400s . The output from the 
        command should look similar to the following image. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic18.png" alt="">
    <p>This command runs for 400 seconds, loads the CPU to 100 percent, and then 
        decreases the CPU to 0 percent after the allotted time. It takes a few 
        minutes for the alarm status to change to In alarm and for an email to 
        send. On the graph, you can see where <b>CPUUtilization</b> has increased above 
        the 60 percent threshold. Navigate to your email inbox for the email 
        address that you used to configure the Amazon SNS subscription. You should 
        see a new email notification from <b>AWS Notifications</b>. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic19.png" alt="">
    <h2>Step 4: Create a CloudWatch dashboard </h2>
    <p>CloudWatch dashboards are customizable home pages in the CloudWatch 
        console that you can use to monitor your resources in a single view. With 
        CloudWatch dashboards, you can even monitor resources that are spread 
        across different Regions. You can use CloudWatch dashboards to create 
        customized views of the metrics and alarms for your AWS resources. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Go to the CloudWatch section in the AWS console. In the left navigation 
        pane, choose <b>Dashboards</b>. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic20.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Create dashboard</b>. </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic21.png" alt="">
    <p>For <b>Dashboard name</b>, enter MyEC2Dashboard and then choose <b>Create dashboard</b>. 
        Choose <b>Metrics</b>. Choose <b>Line</b>.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic22.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>EC2</b>, and then choose <b>Per-Instance Metrics</b>.</p>
    <img src="./Images/pic23.png" alt="">
    <p>Select the check box with <b>Stress Test</b> for the <b>Instance name</b> and 
        <b>CPUUtilization</b> for the <b>Metric name:</b> Choose <b>Create widget</b>. Choose <b>Save 
            dashboard</b>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Now you have created a quick access shortcut to view the <b>CPUUtilization</b> 
        metric for the <b>Stress Test</b> instance. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic24.png" alt="">
    <p>Choose <b>Create widget</b>. Choose <b>Save dashboard</b>.     
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic25.png" alt="">
    <p>Now you have created a quick access shortcut to view the <b>CPUUtilization</b> 
        metric for the <b>Stress Test</b> instance.
    </p>
