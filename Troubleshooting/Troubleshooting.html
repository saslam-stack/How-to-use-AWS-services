    <h1>How to Troubleshoot a Network Issue</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> Senario: You are unable to ping an EC2 instance created through AWS CLI 
        and you also get an error when you enter the IP address in the browser. 
    </P>
    <h2>Step 1:</h2>
    <p>SSH into AWS Linux EC2 instance (Please read below article for SSH instructions).
    </p>
    <a href="https://saslam-stack.github.io/AWS-Linux-system-administration-/How%20to%20SSH%20AWS%20EC2/SSH%20EC2.html">How to SSH into AWS EC2 instance</a>
    <h2>Step 2:</h2>
    <p>Install httpd to check the status of the httpd service, enter the 
        following systemctl command in the terminal window, and press Enter: sudo 
        systemctl status httpd.service 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic1.png" alt="PuTTy screenshot">
    <p>To start the httpd service, enter the following command, and press Enter:  
        sudo systemctl start httpd.service 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic2.png" alt="PuTTy screenshot">
    <p>To check the status of the httpd service again, enter the following 
        systemctl command, and press Enter: sudo systemctl status httpd.service 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic3.png" alt="PuTTy screenshot">
    <p>The httpd service is now running.  You can find Public IP address on AWS management console in 
        details section of EC2 instance: 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic4.png" alt="AWS management console screenshot">
    <p>Now check if webserver is working. Open a new web browser, replace with 
        the public IP of your instance e.g. 52.41.34.77. If you are unable to load 
        your webserver then you need to investigate the VPC and its resources. 
        Keep the error that you received when trying to load Apache in the web 
        browser in mind while troubleshooting this issue. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic5.png" alt="Web browser screenshot">
    <p>Click on VPC in the services section of AWS management console. Use the 
        left navigation pane and check each service within the VPC to confirm that 
        each resource is configured correctly for example 
        Subnets - Are the route tables associated to the correct subnets? 
        Route Tables - Do the route tables have the correct routes? 
        Internet Gateway - Is there an Internet Gateway and is it attached? 
        Security Groups and network ACLs - Are the correct rules configured? 
    </p>

    <img src="./Images/pic7.png" alt="AWS management console Route table screenshot">
    <img src="./Images/pic8.png" alt="AWS management console Internetgateway screenshot">
    <img src="./Images/pic9.png" alt="AWS management console Security group screenshot">
    <p>I discovered, EC2 instance security group only allows inbound traffic from 
        SSH at port 22. Security groups. SG inbound rules needs to be amended to 
        allow HTTP traffic at port 80. 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic10.png" alt="AWS management console Security group screenshot">
    <p>Try to access webserver again. Open a new web browser; enter public IP of 
        your instance e.g. 52.41.34.77 
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/pic11.png" alt="Web browser screenshot">
    <p>Apache is successfully installed and accessible.
